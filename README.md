This app helps to repeat any foreign words every day. It doesn't have database, but it uses localstorage and local JSON dictionary to show random word.

It has 2 modes: select answer or type it.

There is an ability to reset counter any time. It also stores already checked word ids into localstorage to prevent repeating same word each time.
